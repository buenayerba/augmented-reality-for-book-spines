# Augmented Reality for Books on a Bookshelf

Retrieving information about books on a bookshelf by simply pointing the camera at them could make the library and book- store browsing experience more convenient and effective. We present an interactive real-time augmented reality (AR) sys- tem that augments books while they are on a bookshelf. Our system recognizes the desired book by its spine, and displays an AR menu with the relevant information about the book, such as genre, target age, ratings, prices and similar books. The user can interact with the system by clicking on the book spines to open the interactive menu, and swiping left and right to switch between the menus. The paper discusses the proto- type of such a system, and compares several approaches for its implementation.
